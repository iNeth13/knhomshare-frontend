          To be honest at first this website is just a small but since I want to
          improve my skills. I decided to make it big like many websites out
          there. Enough with the back story right. Let's jump to the point. Oh
          wait, I just want to inform you that mobile applications for{" "}
          <span style={{ borderBottom: "1px solid white" }}>KnhomShare</span>{" "}
          are coming.
        </h6>
        <h6 className="about-text-line-height">
          I created this website so that people who love to write can share
          their idea. there amazing journeys to different places, you can find
          more under{" "}
          <Link className="to-topics-link" to="/topics">
            Topics
          </Link>{" "}
          tab. Especially since I love technologies as well as programming, I
          hope many authors will write a lot about Programming techniques ,
          tricks and share them to our fellow developers
        </h6>
        <h6 className="about-text-line-height">
          Many features are still missing from KnhomShare, such as :
          <ul>
            <li>Locations of Places.</li>
            <li>Email Varification when signing up.</li>
            <li>Facebook Login , Google Login.</li>
          </ul>
          I did it on purpose because right now I am focusing on different
          projects, and of course it's about financial as well, some features
          charge money :( But I promise to include them in the upcoming update
          after my current project is finished. See you at KnhomShare v2.
        </h6>
        <h6 className="about-text-line-height">
          Last but not least, let me say thank you to Mr.Sun Tropichwathna for
          this beautiful logo. I really love it man.
